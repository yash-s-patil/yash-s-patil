# 🚀 Projects
### Automated CI/CD Pipeline for Web Application using GitHub, Jenkins, Maven, Ansible, Docker, and Kubernetes on AWS [Link](https://github.com/yash-s-patil/CI-CD-with-Jenkins-Ansible-Docker-Kubernetes-on-AWS)

➤ 🚀 Built and deployed a web application using Tomcat server, and set up continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipeline with GitHub, Jenkins, Maven, and Tomcat.

➤ 🐳 Deployed artifacts on Docker container, wrote Dockerfile, and integrated Docker host with Jenkins to create a CI/CD job for building and deploying on containers.

➤ 🔧 Deployed artifacts on Docker containers using Ansible by setting up an Ansible server, integrating it with Docker host, and creating Ansible playbooks for creating images and containers. Also, integrated Ansible with Jenkins to create a CI/CD job for building code on Ansible and deploying it on a Docker container.

➤ 🎯 Deployed artifacts on Kubernetes using Amazon EKS, wrote manifest files for pod, service, and deployment, and integrated Kubernetes with Ansible to create Ansible playbooks for deployment and service. Also, created a CI/CD job for building code on Ansible and deploying it on Kubernetes.

### Deployment of JavaScript-NodeJs application using Docker, Nexus, and DigitalOcean [Link](https://github.com/yash-s-patil/Deployment-of-JavaScript-NodeJs-application)

➤ 📦 Git cloned an existing project consisting of a JavaScript-Nodejs application. Pulled MongoDB and Mongo-express from DockerHub and created a mongo-network to start containers in it. Started Mongodb and Mongoexpress container with all the necessary parameters and created a new database via Mongo Express Ui.

➤ 🐳 Created a docker-compose file to start mongodb and mongo-express containers instead of using docker run. Created a Dockerfile for our Nodejs Application and built a Docker image. Created a private Docker Registry on AWS ECR and pushed the Docker image to AWS ECR repository.

➤ 🚀 Added the application image in Dockerfile services and started the Docker Container with Docker-compose. Configured persistence for our application data using Docker volumes.

➤ 🌐 Created a Docker repository on Nexus and Configured User Role, Ports, and Firewall rules. Pushed the Docker Image to Nexus Repository. Created a Droplet on DigitalOcean Server and installed Docker. Ran Nexus as a Docker Container on DigitalOcean Server and accessed it from the browser.

### Scalable Node.js Web Service on AWS with Terraform, Nginx, and Python Healthcheck [Link](https://github.com/yash-s-patil/Devops-Assignment)

➤ 🔒 Designed and implemented a secure and scalable public web service on AWS using Terraform and Nginx reverse proxy, with external access limited to ports 80 and 443, and restricted access to internal paths starting with "/internal/..." for enhanced security. 

➤ 🔀 Configured Nginx reverse proxy to redirect traffic from port 80 to 443 and proxy pass to port 3000 for efficient load balancing and routing. 

➤ 🐍 Implemented a custom Python health check script to periodically monitor the service and ensure high availability and reliability.

➤ 📈 Deployed auto scaling and load balancing to the service to handle spikes in traffic and improve overall performance and user experience.
